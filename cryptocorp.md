# Reimagine corporation: A Blockchain CryptoCorp. 

# Premise

Today’s Corporation, coupled with underlying banking infrastructure is incredibly outdated based on an ancient legal system that only takes and an aging bank wire infrastructure. All corporate governance and process are only executed (or violated) at will of each member, recognized by legal system via hundreds and thousands pages of natural language document,  and when distorted or should dispute arise, only enforceable, hopefully, post fact thru litigation - a $500b+ overhead cost per year.

Moreover, companies settles with each other through ACH and Wire that takes anywhere from 24hr to 3-5 days for international and cost anywhere from $5 to $50 per transaction. That is hardly acceptable or even imaginable in the world of bits.

# Corporation from the scratch

Before heading into problem solving, let’s try to mentally design an ideal corporation structure from the scratch.

## From the primitives

What exactly need to be achieved as a for-profit corporation, or more generally, as a collection of  individuals who’re seeking to provide product/service and maximize profits?

1. **A continuous and independent legal identity** that act with the consensus (or collective will) of its members, to interact and contract with external individuals and other legal personality. This allows the entity to exist, receive and provide services without being completely dependent upon the well being or membership of a single individual. By providing the robustness of a corporate entity, it significantly increases the trust level from its partners, customers, and etc. and hence maximizes its potential to make profit in the long term. This is among the most fundamental reasons that corporation exist at all.

2. **A legal liability shield** that stands in between external world and its members, who would otherwise subject to potentially unlimited liability. One could argue this exist out of necessity in lieu of the fact that it can be hard or impossible to accurately attribute legally the responsibility of a legal entity’s action to a single individual member, hence by nature of that, the legal entity would take the liability on behalf of its members. More importantly , a legal shield enables its members to take on good-willed, yet more risky business adventures when necessary, without risking major or even unrecoverable consequence for a single failed business endeavor. 

3. **An efficient mechanism to reach consensus and act accordingly**. Whenever an entity contains more than one single entity, there need to be a way such that the group would act in a consistent state. The consensus, however, does not mean in any way that a unilateral agreement, not even a majority-based agreement, need to be reached on each single decision - in fact that is extremely rarely the state, but instead a set of rules that where the members would abide by such that conflicts can be efficiently resolved and the entity would move forward. Without such set of rules (usually involving  hierarchy of decision power and scope of responsibilities), one could imagine, each action would require at least O(N^2) level of coordination efforts even for a single round of negotiation.

4. **A potentially tiered membership ruleset**, that governs appointing and addition/removal of members - shareholders, founders, executives, employees, etc., who each bear different level of responsibility, liability, risk, control and sharing.
5. **A set of rule that governs acquiring, managing and selling of its assets**, which could include:
* Financial Capital
* Reputation / Branding
* Intellectual Property, e.g. software code
* Physical Assets, e.g. lands
* Financial Contractual Rights (e.g. account receivable, ownership stake)

6. A common set of governance rules that** audits its member’s actions **and** allow for replacement/appointment of individuals **to the roles in its membership structure

7. A agreed upon mechanism to **distribute and redistribute capital, profits and dividends** upon trigger events

To summarize, based on contractarian theory a corporation can be conceived as a "**nexus of contracts**" - both social and private, that governs:

1. legal status, responsibility and liability between corporation and the law

2. contractual relationship between corporation and rest of the world

3. contractual relationship among its members

## The Ideal Corporation

At an abstract level, what would an ideal corporation look like, that maximizes the economic efficiency at an individual level and aggregate level of an economy?

1. Corporate actions are checked against and executed only within boundary of its contractual obligations with its counterparties, contracts among all its members and under the law

2. All membership addition/appointments are executed in accordance to its pre-defined membership rules, and that all members trust its execution.

3. Every member executes only within its boundary of authorization / contract

4. All corporate actions are fully auditable, and sufficiently transparent to and only to those that have the need and pre-agreed upon rights (e.g. financial statement transparent to shareholders but not all employees)

5. It could efficiently enter into contracts with any other entities in a way that minimizes the trust required on both entities. This can be achieved via a "firewall" that automatically put both party’s actions in check, such that the parties could be confidently entering into the contract without necessary previous knowledge or experience of the other party.

6. A sufficient level of proof can be extracted and provided to the counterparty based on upon its past record and reputation such that a base level of trust can be bootstrapped. 

7. When uncertainty of a contractual execution are unavoidable, a proportional level of assets are being efficiently collateralized (without excessive burden of working capital lock up) and be redistributed to the right party upon certain events -   transparently, fairly, and in a risk minimized way.

8. Jurisdictional differences no longer become a friction for international corporation interaction

## The Haskoin Corp

Think about the case of Haskoin Corp - a 3 person startup that develops its own open source Haskell based implementation of Bitcoin and also provide enterprise level solution on top of Haskoin. The 3 team members are distributed across 3 countries in Europe.

The traditional way of managing a corp like  that is  heavyweight and hard to enforce.  There’s executives, board members, employees and contractors. How will it be governed? there's going to be expenses, and revenues. who control the finances? where to setup the bank account? how about revenues, who control that?

### The legacy route

There are two obvious routes for Haskoin Corp.  They can obviously forgo the legal infrastructure largely, and rely on trust on each member. Alternatively, they could setup one or more LLC and have a more formal legal papers for governance structure,which cost anywhere from $500 to $10k. 

The team members may decide to setup a corporate bank account, controlled by the CEO or CFO. Alternatively, they just use an excel spread sheet and members would pay and then expense it.  Internally, they may use an accounting / expense management software  like Xero that is connected to the bank account.
